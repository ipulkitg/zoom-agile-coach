# Agile Meeting Assistant

**Agile Meeting Assistant** is an AI-powered tool designed to provide **agile project planning recommendations** during **Zoom meetings**. By leveraging **OpenAI GPT** and **LangChain**, the system listens to ongoing conversations and offers **real-time suggestions** to help teams align with agile methodologies.

Check out the hosted project [here](https://portfolio-ipulkitg.vercel.app/).

## 📈 How It Works

1. **Transcript Ingestion**: 
   - Meeting transcripts from **Zoom calls** are processed for analysis.

2. **Insight Generation**:
   - The **LangChain** framework retrieves context or integrates additional knowledge (if configured).
   - **OpenAI GPT** generates agile recommendations based on the meeting discussions.

3. **Notebook Demonstration**:
   - The Jupyter Notebook walks you through ingesting transcripts, generating insights, and iterating recommendations for project planning.
